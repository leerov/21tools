Hi, if you're seeing this, then it's really useful!
This repository collects useful system improvements based on the conditions provided.
I urge you to refrain from using these utilities frequently if you do so mindlessly.
Open the sources of this repository and see what is now available to you (and me ;-) )!
Read the sources (there's not much there). Understand HOW it works.
Have fun hacking :-‚Äù <3 (hint: start with the .zshrc file and the concept of environment variables)
Enjoy!
